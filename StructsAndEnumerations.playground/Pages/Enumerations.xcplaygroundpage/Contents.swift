 ## Enumerations
 Create an enum for the current iPhone product line. Copy and paste your struct from the last page into this page. Add one more property to your iOS Developer struct of type `iPhone` (assuming that's the name of the enum you just created). Create an instance of iOSDeveloper, that contains your new iPhone property.
 */

/*:
 
 Add raw values to the enum you made above. These raw values should be a nice, readable string for the name of the iPhone. If one of your enum cases is `case iPhoneXS`, its raw value should be `"iPhone XS"`, etc.
 
 */

/*:
 
 Make a conditional statement that checks your iOSDeveloper instance's `iPhone` property and compares it to each of the enum cases. In each if statement, write a print statement stating which iPhone the iOS Developer has.
 
 For example, if the iPhone they have is an iPhone XS, print that out. Use the `.rawValue` so you don't have to write out the name of the iPhone. Remember that String raw values are great because we won't mess up the string if we use the `.rawValue` property.
