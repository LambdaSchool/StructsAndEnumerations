/*:
 ## Structs
 Create a struct type for an iOS Developer called `iOSDeveloper`. Your type should contain properties for name, company, years of experience, salary, programming language, and and an `isEligibleForBenefits` property that should be a `Bool`.
 */

/*:
 Create an instance of your `iOSDeveloper` struct using your future developer self. Print out a statement that includes the salary of your instance (ex. "When I am a developer, I will be making $[salary].")
 */


/*:
 Go back to the struct and add a custom initializer to it, giving the programming language property a default value of "Swift".
